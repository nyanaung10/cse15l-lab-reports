Hello CSE 15L! Ready for the new and exciting quarter!!

In this class I hope to learn more about: 
1. Applications that can maximize my work flow
2. New code features
3. Collaborating with many of the fellow students. 
4. Make more friends

The following is my favorite soccer club and player: 
- **Barcelona**
